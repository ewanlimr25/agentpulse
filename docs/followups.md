# Followups

Single consolidated punch list of everything this audit surfaced that hasn't been fixed yet. Ordered by priority. Each item links to the doc that discusses it in depth.

Already completed in this pass:

- [x] `.env.example` added with every env var + defaults
- [x] `make migrate-up` now applies all 13 Postgres + 16 ClickHouse migrations
- [x] `LICENSE` added (PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0) — protects against commercial resale / hosted services
- [x] `README.md` rewritten for current state
- [x] Tutorial, architecture, feasibility analysis, and recommendations docs written

Everything below is open.

---

## Tier 1 — do before telling anyone else to clone it

These are fresh-clone friction points that a new user will hit in the first 20 minutes.

- [x] **First-run wizard.** After migrations, the UI shows a blank dashboard. Detect "no projects exist" and render a "Create your first project" form that calls `POST /api/v1/projects` and displays the one-time `api_key`. Today the user must use `curl`. _(model: sonnet · effort: medium — React form + one API call, but needs empty-state detection and key display)_
- [x] **`scripts/init.sh` bootstrap.** One command that runs `make dev-up && make migrate-up`, creates a demo project, prints the API key, and writes it to `.env.local`. Prior art: every indie tool that wants adoption (Plausible, Umami, Supabase CLI). _(model: haiku · effort: low — shell script, deterministic, well-understood pattern)_
- [x] **Collector in default docker-compose.** Remove `profiles: ["full"]` from the collector service so `make dev-up` starts everything. Discussed in [feasibility-analysis.md](./feasibility-analysis.md#friction-points-ordered-by-pain). _(model: haiku · effort: low — delete one YAML key, mechanical)_
- [x] **`CONTRIBUTING.md`.** Dev setup (mirror tutorial), commit conventions (already used but not documented), test + lint expectations, PR checklist. _(model: haiku · effort: low — prose doc, content already exists in other docs)_
- [x] **Python SDK README expansion.** Currently 12 lines (vs TypeScript's 136). Mirror the TS SDK's structure: install → minimal example → framework auto-instrumentors (CrewAI/AutoGen/LlamaIndex/LangChain) → environment variables → run-ID context. _(model: haiku · effort: low — documentation mirroring, no logic)_

## Tier 2 — production safety

Don't expose AgentPulse to the internet until these land. See [architecture.md §ingest auth](./architecture.md#ingest-authentication) and [feasibility-analysis.md §security](./feasibility-analysis.md#security-posture-local-use) for detail.

- [x] **TLS in the backend.** `HTTP_TLS_CERT` + `HTTP_TLS_KEY` env vars bind HTTPS if both are set. Otherwise HTTP as today. Even if most people front with nginx/Caddy/Cloudflare, shipping the native path is table-stakes. _(model: sonnet · effort: medium — Go TLS wiring + env var handling, low ambiguity)_
- [x] **Collector validates ingest tokens.** The REST API enforces Bearer auth; the OTel receiver on `:4317/:4318` does not. Add a gRPC/HTTP interceptor that looks up `Authorization: Bearer` against `project_ingest_tokens`. Opt-out via env var for single-machine dev. _(model: sonnet · effort: high — gRPC/HTTP interceptor in Go OTel collector, auth lookup, opt-out env var)_
- [x] **Webhook signing.** Budget/alert webhooks POST unsigned bodies. Add `X-AgentPulse-Signature: sha256=...` HMAC over the body, keyed per alert rule. _(model: sonnet · effort: medium — standard HMAC pattern but per-rule keying needs care)_
- [x] **Rotate `agentpulse:agentpulse` defaults at setup.** `scripts/init.sh` generates random credentials and writes them to `.env` + `docker-compose.override.yml`, instead of shipping with the same default everywhere. _(model: sonnet · effort: medium — credential generation + docker-compose.override.yml templating)_
- [x] **Audit log.** Append-only ClickHouse table `audit_events` with (timestamp, actor_token_hash, ip, endpoint, method, resource_id, outcome). The WarnDefaults mechanism in `backend/internal/config/config.go:147` is the right idea but stops short of actual audit. _(model: sonnet · effort: medium — schema + insert path is straightforward; risk is missing call sites)_
- [x] **CSRF protection for state-changing endpoints.** Cookie-based sessions don't exist today (Bearer only), but if the UI ever gains cookie auth this becomes required. _(model: haiku · effort: low — no-op for now, Bearer-only; just a comment/TODO)_

## Tier 3 — CI / testing gaps

Backend and SDKs have decent unit tests. CI only runs the TypeScript SDK.

- [x] **`.github/workflows/backend.yml`** — `go test -race ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck`, `gosec`, `gofmt -l` guard. Required-check on main. _(model: haiku · effort: low — boilerplate Go CI YAML)_
- [x] **`.github/workflows/web.yml`** — type check, ESLint. Required-check on main. Note: Vitest not yet installed in web/ — that's a follow-on. _(model: haiku · effort: low — boilerplate Next.js CI YAML)_
- [x] **`.github/workflows/collector.yml`** — build, test, smoke test (send a span, assert it appears in ClickHouse via service containers). _(model: sonnet · effort: medium)_
- [x] **E2E tests.** `tests/e2e/` now has Playwright tests: create project via UI, OTLP trace ingestion, project list, budget rule CRUD, alert rule CRUD. Workflow at `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` (marked `continue-on-error: true` while stack startup stabilises). _(model: sonnet · effort: high)_
- [x] **Migration smoke test in CI.** Fresh Postgres + ClickHouse → migrations applied → assert expected tables exist. `.github/workflows/migrations.yml`. _(model: sonnet · effort: medium)_

## Tier 4 — missing UI surfaces

Backend works, frontend doesn't. Each is a small React page talking to existing endpoints.

- [x] **Ingest-token management page** (generate / list / revoke) — Settings > Tokens tab; one-time token modal with copy-to-clipboard _(model: haiku · effort: low — CRUD page, endpoints already exist)_
- [x] **Retention-policy settings page** (`PUT /api/v1/projects/:projectId/storage/retention`) — already shipped in Settings > Storage > RetentionCard _(model: haiku · effort: low — single PUT form, endpoint exists)_
- [x] **PII-redaction config page** (regex patterns per project) — already shipped in Settings > Security > PII Redaction _(model: sonnet · effort: medium — regex editor + per-project config needs validation UX)_
- [x] **Email-digest settings page** (frequency + recipients + on/off) — already shipped in Alerts > Notification Preferences _(model: haiku · effort: low — form + toggle, endpoint exists)_
- [x] **Eval custom-judge editor** (prompt template authoring, dry-run against sample spans) — dry-run added to AddEvalConfigModal; backend endpoint `POST /evals/config/dry-run` _(model: sonnet · effort: high — prompt template authoring + dry-run against live spans, complex UX)_
- [x] **Loop-detection tuning** (threshold + window per project, currently hardcoded) — migration 016, backend GET/PUT `/loop-config`, Settings > Loop Detection tab _(model: haiku · effort: medium — threshold/window form per project, currently hardcoded so needs backend wiring too)_
- [x] **Playground A/B statistical significance** display (sample size + p-value + winner indicator) — ABStatsDisplay component with Welch's t-test, renders below variant grid _(model: opus · effort: high — p-value display is trivial; choosing the right test, handling small N and unequal groups, and surfacing it correctly requires statistical reasoning)_

## Tier 5 — documentation

- [x] **`docs/deployment.md`** — Fly.io, Railway, Cloud Run, bare-VPS recipes. At minimum, a working `fly.toml` + `Dockerfile` for the backend. _(model: sonnet · effort: medium — working config needs testing, not just prose)_
- [x] **`docs/troubleshooting.md`** — extracted and expanded from [getting-started.md §Troubleshooting](./getting-started.md#troubleshooting). Cover: ClickHouse disk full, Postgres pool exhaustion, collector lag behind agents, stuck eval jobs, websocket disconnects. _(model: haiku · effort: low — expansion of existing content)_
- [x] **OpenAPI / Swagger** — hand-written OpenAPI 3.1 spec at `docs/openapi.yaml` (2,364 lines, 85 operations, 63 paths). Covers all Chi routes with correct auth schemes, parameters, and response codes. _(model: sonnet · effort: high — hand-writing or generating from Chi handlers across many routes)_
- [x] **Architecture Decision Records.** Four ADRs in `docs/adr/`: ADR-001 dual-storage, ADR-002 React Flow, ADR-003 OTel-native, ADR-004 Go backend. _(model: opus · effort: medium — requires reasoning about why decisions were made, not just what)_
- [x] **`docs/cost-sizing.md`** — resource footprint + cloud sizing estimates with methodology and self-benchmark commands. _(model: sonnet · effort: medium — needs empirical numbers; some benchmarking required)_
- [x] **`docs/sdk-versions.md`** — tested Python / Node / framework matrix sourced from actual pyproject.toml and package.json versions. _(model: haiku · effort: low — matrix table, mostly already known)_

## Tier 6 — product direction

Covered in depth in [recommendations.md](./recommendations.md). Summary here for planning purposes.

P0 (next 8 weeks):

- [ ] **Single-binary "indie mode"** (SQLite + DuckDB) — [recommendations.md §P0-1](./recommendations.md#p0-1-single-binary-indie-mode-sqlite--duckdb-backend) _(model: opus · effort: high — storage layer swap, major architectural decision with many unknowns)_

## Housekeeping

- [ ] **Roadmap refresh.** [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md) is 19 lines and covers only "What We Cover Well." Merge Tiers 1–5 above into a live roadmap, mark P0/P1 lanes. _(model: haiku · effort: low — merge existing lists into one doc)_
- [ ] **Codemap / file index.** A 1-page doc listing every significant Go package, React component directory, and migration. Helps new contributors orient. `doc-updater` agent can regenerate on each release. _(model: haiku · effort: low — `doc-updater` agent handles this)_
- [ ] **Release process.** Semantic version tags, GitHub release notes, published Docker images for `ghcr.io/<owner>/agentpulse-{backend,collector,web}`. _(model: sonnet · effort: medium — Docker image publishing + semver tags + GH releases needs real setup)_
- [ ] **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** if the repo is ever made public. _(model: haiku · effort: low — boilerplate)_
- [ ] **Security disclosure policy** (`SECURITY.md`) — how people report vulnerabilities. _(model: haiku · effort: low — boilerplate)_

## How to use this file

- Treat it as the backlog. Cross items off with `- [x]` as they ship.
- If an item grows into real scope, promote it to an issue or a dedicated doc and leave a link here.
- When you complete a tier, trim it down to a one-line summary — this file should stay readable as things get done.
